            <h2>Experience Earned From Master's Degree Projects:</h2>
            
            <p>• Final Thesis: Detection of malware in android applications via android permissions using Tree-Based Ensembles. Achieved 95% accuracy by deploying our composite model which involves specialized tree-based machine learning algorithms such as RandomForest, DecisionTrees, XGBoost, AdaBoost classifiers for the detection of malware.<br><br>
                • Exploitation of vulnerabilities and gaining privilege of root access from two windows system namely (BLUE and ICE) from tryhackme website and a Linux system (Nezuko) from vulnhub website.<br><br>
                • Analyzing corporate network’s security and its possible vulnerabilities.<br> <br>
                • Collection of SIEM (Security information and Event Management) system logs caused due to various potential threats out in the wild.<br><br>
                • Development of a web application called as Kid’s corner (Front end (UI): HTML5;Back-end: PHP; Database: MySQL). The project mainly concentrates on input and server-side validation, Complex password authentication, SHA-256 hashing and addition of SALT to the password before it is getting stored in the database, CAPTCHA authentication, Prevention of XSS and SQL injections, session and cookie management, overcoming OWASP top 10 listed vulnerabilities.<br><br>
                • Development of a web application called Kid’s square by creating an EC2 instance from AWS platform. Wordpress is used for developing the UI of my application and Securing the application itself by using various other tools available from AWS such as AWS IAM, AWS Cognito, AWS shield, Web application firewall, Certbot Encryption on Linux (SSL/TLS), Cloud watch, CloudTrail, AWS Guard duty and AWS Inspector.<br><br>
                • In depth analysis of the Malwares (Emotet and Dridex botnets)  by clearly understanding their exfiltration process, IOC’s (Indicators of Compromise) and their kill chain process deployed for infection, followed by static analysis of the malware and the finally figuring out the counter measures for the elimination of the malware.<br><br>
                • In-depth overview in implementing the RSA digital signature scheme for a piece of phrase and understanding the signature generation and its respective verification. <br><br>
                • Security testing of a given application that involves White-box testing, black-box testing, SAST (static application security testing), DAST (Dynamic application testing) initially and automated tools were also used for further inspection of spotting the bugs later. Most of the possible errors formed due to lack of secure coding guidelines was fixed and replaced.<br><br>
